# Description:
Includes GTK theme and Emerald. Highly recommend using nautilus-elementary http://www.webupd8.org/2010/01/nautilus-elementary-simplified-nautilus.html. 

> Notes:
> This theme is in beta stage. I plan on including additional skins for Firefox, Chromium, and other applications. 

> Panel background must be set manually. Navigate to Promethium theme folder Panel and choose one of the panel backgrounds (eg panel_22.png for a 22 px height panel).
